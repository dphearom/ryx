Description: Given a dependent variable y and a vector of one or more independent variables,
  This function would then compute a correlation table with columns of variable names, 
  r for correlation value, p for p values, and sigif for stars falgging the p values. In this case,
  *** represents p < 0.001, ** represents p < 0.01, and * represents p < 0.05. When the independent variables are not 
  provided, the correlation tables are created for all of the variables in the dataset.
